# P2P chat
A simple peer-to-peer chat that uses the PeerMessage plugin for communication and the CryptMessage plugin and Ecies for encryption.

About This is a simple peer-to-peer chat which uses the PeerMessage plugin. After selecting a certificate, you will be displayed to others. You can add them as a "friend". This means that you can exchange messages with them. Adding as a friend is necessary on both sides. Messages that are not from a friend will be discarded. To disguise the recipient of a message, it will be forwarded even if it is meant for you. The sender of a message can be identified by the public key. The messages are encrypted using the CryptMessage plugin and Ecies.
